//undefined 

var firstName ;

console.log(firstName) //undefined   || becasue we decalred it but we didn't assigned 
//value to it...

firstName = "rajesh" ;//value assigned

console.log(typeof firstName) // string assigned

//null --- means nothing

let myVariable = null;
// in jvascript variable can assigned without any value
// will return undefined 
console.log(myVariable) //output null

console.log(typeof myVariable) //output object (bug in javascript)
