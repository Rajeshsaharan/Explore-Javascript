//we can also declare variable using let keyword

let firstName = "rajesh"

console.log(firstName)

//convention -- use let keyword maximum during variable declare

//diffrence between var & let 

//var keyword can be redeclared & reassigned but let dont

var age = 23
var age = 25 //redeclared & reassigned

//////////////

let course = "brt" //declared & assigned
//let course = "bpt" //cant redeclared 
course = "bpt" //but can reassigned in same block scope* --will discuss later

///////////////
// for constant we can use "const" keyword

const pie = 3.14
//pie = 3.25 // cant redeclared & reassigned
