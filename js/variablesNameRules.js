//rules for naming variables

// you cant start with number

//var 1value = 20 //wrong syntx

//we cant use space during declaring variables

// var first Name = "rajesh" //wrong

//in the case of special character we can use only $ or _ underscore

var $Name = "rajesh" //valid
var first_name = "rajesh"  //valid

//convention -- in javascript use use camelcase writing for declaring varible

var firstName = "rajesh" // for javascript (camel case writing)
var first_name = "rajesh" //for python (snake case writing)
